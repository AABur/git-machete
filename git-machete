            If the definition file is empty, the branch will be added as the first root of the tree of branch dependencies.
            Otherwise, the desired upstream (parent) branch can be specified with `--onto`.
            This option is not mandatory, however; if skipped, git machete will try to automatically infer the target upstream.
            If the upstream branch can be inferred, the user will be presented with inferred branch and asked to confirm.
            Also, if the given branch does not exist, user will be asked whether it should be created.

            Note: the same effect (except branch creation) can be always achieved by manually editing the definition file.

            See `git machete help fork-point' for more details on meaning of the "fork point".

            Since the result of the command does not depend on the tree of branch dependencies, the branch in question does not need to occur in the definition file.

            Options:

            Usage: git machete fork-point [<branch>]

            Outputs SHA of the fork point commit for the given branch (the commit at which the history of the branch actually diverges from history of any other branch).
            If no branch is specified, the currently checked out branch is assumed.

            The returned fork point will be assumed as the default place where the history of the branch starts in the commands `diff', `reapply', `slide-out', and most notably `update'.
            In other words, `git machete' treats the fork point as the most recent commit in the log of the given branch that has NOT been introduced on that very branch, but on some other (usually earlier) branch.

            Since the result of the command does not depend on the tree of branch dependencies, the branch in question does not need to occur in the definition file.

            Note: to determine this place in history, `git machete' uses a heuristics based on reflogs of local branches.
            This yields a correct result in typical cases, but there are some situations (esp. when some local branches have been deleted) where the fork point might not be determined correctly.
            Thus, all rebase-involving operations (`reapply', `slide-out' and `update') run `git rebase' in the interactive mode and allow to specify the fork point explictly by a command-line option.

            Also, `git machete fork-point' is different (and more powerful) than `git merge-base --fork-point', since the latter takes into account only the reflog of the one provided upstream branch,
            while the former scans reflogs of all local branches.
            This makes machete's `fork-point' work correctly even when the tree definition has been modified and one or more of the branches changed their corresponding upstream branch.

            Removes the given branch (or multiple branches) from the branch tree definition.
            Then, rebases the downstream (child) branch of the last specified branch on the top of the upstream (parent) branch of the first specified branch.
            The most common use is to slide out a single branch whose upstream was a `develop'/`master' branch and that has been recently merged.

            Since this tool is designed to perform only one rebase at the end, provided branches must form a chain, i.e the following conditions must be met:
            * (n+1)-th branch must be the ONLY downstream branch of the n-th branch.
            * all provided branches must have exactly one downstream branch (even if only one branch is to be slid out)
            * all provided branches must have an upstream branch (so, in other words, roots of branch dependency tree cannot be slid out - also applies if only one branch is specified).

            For example, let's assume the following dependency tree:

            develop
                adjust-reads-prec
                    block-cancel-order

            And now let's assume that `adjust-reads-prec' and later `block-cancel-order' were merged to develop.
            After running `git machete slide-out adjust-reads-prec block-cancel-order' the tree will be reduced to:

            develop
                change-table
                    drop-location-type

            and `change-table' will be rebased onto develop (fork point for this rebase is configurable, see `-d' option below).

            Note: This command doesn't delete any branches from git, just removes them from the tree of branch dependencies.

            Usage: git machete s[tatus] [-l|--list-commits]

            Outputs a tree-shaped status of the branches listed in the definition file.

            Apart from simply ASCII-formatting the definition file, this also:
            * if any remotes are defined for the repository:
              - prints `(untracked [on <remote>]/ahead of <remote>/behind <remote>/diverged from <remote>)' message for each branch that is not in sync with its remote counterpart;
            * colors the edges between upstream (parent) and downstream (children) branches depending on whether downstream branch commit is a direct descendant of the upstream branch commit:
              - red edge means that the downstream branch commit is NOT a direct descendant of the upstream branch commit (basically, the downstream branch is out of sync with its upstream branch),
              - yellow means that the opposite holds true, i.e. the downstream branch is in sync with its upstream branch, but the fork point of the downstream branch is a different commit than upstream branch tip,
              - green means that downstream branch is in sync with its upstream branch (so just like for yellow edge) and the fork point of downstream branch is EQUAL to the upstream branch tip.
            * displays the custom annotations (see help on `format') next to each branch, if present;
            * optionally lists commits introduced on each branch if `--list-commits' is supplied.

            Note: in practice, both yellow and red edges suggest that the downstream branch should be updated against its upstream.
            Yellow typically indicates that there are/were commits from some other branches on the path between upstream and downstream and that a closer look at the log of the downstream branch might be necessary.

            Options:
            -l, --list-commits            Additionally lists the messages of commits introduced on each branch.
        """,
        "traverse": """
            Usage: git machete traverse [-l|--list-commits]

            Traverses the branch dependency in pre-order (i.e. simply in the order as they occur in the definition file) and for each branch:
            * if the branch is not in "green" sync with its parent/upstream (see help for `status'):
              - prompts the user whether to rebase the branch onto into its upstream branch - equivalent to `git machete update' with no options passed;
            * if the branch is not tracked on a remote, ahead its remote counterpart or diverged from the counterpart:
              - prompts the user whether to push the branch (possibly with `--force' if the branches diverged);
            * alternatively, if the branch is behind its remote counterpart:
              - prompts the user whether to pull the branch;
            * and finally, if user confirmed any of those operations:
              - prints the updated `status'.

            Note that even if the traverse flow is stopped (typically due to rebase conflicts), running `git machete traverse' after the rebase is done will pick up the job where it stopped.
            In other words, there is no need to explicitly ask to "continue" as it is the case with e.g. `git rebase'.

            Options:
            -l, --list-commits    Additionally lists the messages of commits introduced on each branch when printing the status.
        """,
        "up": """
            Usage: git machete up [<branch>]

            Outputs name of the branch that is the direct parent of the given branch (or current branch, if none specified).
        """,
        "update": """
            Usage: git machete update [-f|--fork-point=<fork-point-commit>]

            Interactively rebase the current branch on the top of its upstream (parent) branch.
            This is useful e.g. for syncing the current branch with changes introduced by an upstream branch like `develop', or changes commited on the parent branches.
            The chunk of the history to be rebased starts at the automatically computed fork point of the current branch by default, but can also be set explicitly by `--fork-point'.
            See `git machete help fork-point' for more details on meaning of the "fork point".

            Options:
            -f, --fork-point=<fork-point-commit>    Specifies the alternative fork point commit after which the rebased part of history is meant to start.
